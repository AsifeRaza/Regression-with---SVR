# Regression-with---SVR

In this project we will apply Î½-SVR from a software package of your choice (e.g. scikit-learn,
libsvm) to the same dataset used in exercise sheet 5. The training set TrainingRidge.csv
and the validation set ValidationRidge.csv can be found on ISIS. Do not center, whiten
or expand the data before training (otherwise the proposed hyperparameter ranges become inadequate)
